                <h2><strong>Problems</strong></h2>
                <p>Deforestation of protected areas is a serious threat to biodiversity, caused by agriculture, logging and urbanization. Raising awareness about the importance of forests is crucial. The population can help by spreading information and choosing sustainable products.</p>

                <h2><strong>Technology</strong></h2>
                <p>Drones that will scan the areas where they are being protected and if it is analyzed that deforestation is taking place there, the nearest police station is informed to intervene in the deforestation and after the area is released, robots are sent to replant the lost trees</p>
